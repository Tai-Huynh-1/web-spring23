// = is the assignment operator (assign a value to a variable)
// JS has 5 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, undefined, null

var myName = "Tai"; // string
var age = 10; // number
var active = true; // boolean (true or false)

var membership1 = undefined; // undefined (a variable has be created in memory, but has not been assigned a value)
var membership2; // undefined

var date_created = null; // null (null is a proper value, the variable has been assigned a value of null) (empty placeholder, lack of value, empty value)

console.log("date_created", date_created);
